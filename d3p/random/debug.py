""" PRNG interface for use in d3p to sample DP perturbation noise when debugging.

This is a simple wrapper around the standard jax.random PRNG. It is not
cryptographically secure and should not be used in production settings, but
runs faster than the secure variant and thus can be used to speed up debugging runs.

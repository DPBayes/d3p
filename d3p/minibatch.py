    """ Returns functions to fetch (randomized) batches of a given dataset by
    Poisson sampling.

    As `split_batchify_data` and `subsample_batchify_data, this takes the common epoch
    viewpoint to training, where an epoch is understood to be one pass over the data set.
    However, the data set is not shuffled and split to generate batches - instead
    every element is included in a batch with probability `q`, independent of any other element.

    This means that the number of elements in a batch varies (it follows a Poisson distribution).
    In order to facilitate efficient computation, returned batches are always of size
    `max_batch_size` - padding is used whenever the number of sampled elements in a batch is lower
    and a boolean mask is returned additionally to the batch to indicate which elements are valid (not padded).

    If the number of sampled elements is larger than `max_batch_size`, two different behaviors are possible
    depending on the value of `handle_oversized_batch`:
        - `truncate`: the batch is simply truncated to `max_batch_size`
        - `suppress`: the batch sample is discarded as invalid, i.e., an empty batch is returned.


    :param arrays: Tuple of arrays constituting the data set to be batchified.
        All arrays must have the same length on the first axis.
    :param q: The subsampling ratio, i.e., the probability with which an element is included in a batch.
    :param max_batch_size: The structural size of batches returned as an integer. Alternatively, a float between 0 and 1,
        in which case max_batch_size is set to the corresponding quantile of the Poisson distribution of batch sizes.
    :param handle_oversized_batch: Optional. How to handle cases when the number of sampled elements exceeds `max_batch_size`.
        Must be `truncate` or `suppress`. Default: `truncate`.
    :param rng_suite: Optional. The PRNG suite to use. Defaults to the cryptographically-secure d3p.random.
    :return: tuple (init_fn: () -> (num_batches, batchifier_state), get_batch: (i, batchifier_state) -> batch)
        init_fn() returns the number of batches per epoch and an initialized state of the batchifier for the epoch.
        get_batch() returns the next batch of elements from the data set and a Boolean mask indicating padding (True indicates a valid element).

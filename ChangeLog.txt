- master:
    - ! Renamed main package 'dppp' to 'd3p' !
    - Upgraded stable numpyro dependency to 0.8.0
    - Dropped support for Python 3.6
    - Fix: DPSVI perturbation was too large (scaled by minibatch size)
    - Fix: dputil.approximate_sigma could enter an infinite loop for some parameters
    - Feature: Fast minibatch sampling using Feistel-based CUDA-Shuffle
    - Removed: num_obs_total argument to DPSVI.
    - Removed: TunableSVI class.
    - Removed: minibatch context handler - superseded by numpyro plate primitive.
    - Moved: Routines for sampling from posterior/prior in d3p.svi
- 0.1.0: Initial not-quite-a-release
